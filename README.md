# Web_Development

In this course we will start our Journey in Web Development.  We will start wtih HTTP and HTML and move into CSS and JavaScript.  We will make our way into server side technologies and interfacing with DataBases. We will then move into JavaScript Frameworks like VueJS. Then, we will deploy our Application to the Cloud. Learning all the way. Challenging ourselves and taking everything in small chunks with very clear definitions and descriptions, always leaving us something to grow on.
